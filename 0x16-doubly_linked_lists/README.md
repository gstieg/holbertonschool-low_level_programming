     *What is a Doubly Linked List


**Resources**

General:

	* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
	* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
	* Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
	* All your files should end with a new line
	* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
	* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
	* You are not allowed to use global variables
	* No more than 5 functions per file
	* The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free, printf and exit
	* In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
	* The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called lists.h
	* Don’t forget to push your header file
	* All your header files should be include guarded
